# RungeKuttaMethodusingOOPs
Object-Oriented Implementation of the Runge-Kutta Method for Numerical Solutions of Differential Equations

Overview
This project implements the Runge-Kutta 4th Order (RK4) Method using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++. The RK4 method is a widely used numerical approach for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with high accuracy.

The system is designed to be modular, scalable, and reusable, making it suitable for scientific computing, engineering simulations, and mathematical modeling. It uses template classes, enabling flexibility across various data types and ensuring efficiency in numerical computations.

Key Features
 Robust OOP Architecture
Implements a base solver class for extensibility.
Uses polymorphism to enable different numerical solvers.
Encapsulates solver logic for improved maintainability.

 Runge-Kutta Method Implementation
Uses the RK4 algorithm, a higher-order technique for solving differential equations.
Can solve multi-variable systems, demonstrated with the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model.

 Optimized Code Design
Smart Pointers (unique_ptr) ensure efficient memory management.
Template-based classes allow flexibility with different numerical types.
Formatted output provides structured and readable simulation results.

Lotka-Volterra Model
Demonstrates a real-world application of RK4 by simulating predator-prey population dynamics.
Models interactions between species using differential equations.
Shows how populations change over time based on growth and decay factors.

How It Works
User Input: Provide initial population densities for prey and predator.
Simulation Execution: Run the RK4 solver using the defined Lotka-Volterra equations.
Results Display: Outputs a formatted time-series table of prey and predator populations.
